# repo

## Overview

Create PP

## Support OS
  - OSfamily
   - RedHat


## Usage

 Edit config.pp with your own repository.

 You create bunch of repo files, What I thought we can either use template as one file, but the limitation will you have to define keys, values everywhere. 

 
## Limitations
 
 We are not using params.pp here, looks like create_resources only avaliable in the same pp file, you can't repoint the parameters out side the pp file
